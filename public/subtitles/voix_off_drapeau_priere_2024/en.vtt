00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.480
Before each ascent,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.260
Sherpas participate in traditional rituals,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.960
praying for a safe journey and honoring the memory of their ancestors,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.550
as well as those climbers who have died on the mountain.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.340
For them,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.129
climbing Everest is both a means of livelihood and an act of devotion to their

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.469
mountain heritage.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.049
Their intimate knowledge of the mountain and their mountaineering expertise make them invaluable guides

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:26.059
for Western expeditions.
