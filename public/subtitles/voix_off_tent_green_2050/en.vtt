00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.050
The Everest base camp was moved due to melting ice that made the old

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.359
location dangerous due to increased risk of avalanches,

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.819
landslides and falling ice blocks.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.559
This move was aimed at ensuring the safety of tourists facing new dangers posed by

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.129
climate change.

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:18.899
Today,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.309
the ice has melted,

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.870
leaving room for streams and vegetation.
