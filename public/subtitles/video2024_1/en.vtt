00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.880
We have respect for Everest,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.199
it is our mother.

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:06.150
If this mountain did not exist,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.170
imagine the life we would have.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.939
We consider the mountain as a divine symbol.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.390
We sing a song to it, the words of which say I have come to you,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.250
I beg you,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.270
love me.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.899
We regularly recite the mantra of compassion.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.270
Om mani padme hum

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:28.200
On April 17, 2008, a Buddhist puja took place at the base camp.

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.659
In the Sherpa calendar,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.029
it is the day of happiness and luck.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.799
On that day,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.599
ice axes and crampons are blessed.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.439
A lama, a mountain guide, leads the ceremony by chanting mantras.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.040
Offerings are made to appease the gods.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.190
During this two-hour ceremony,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.139
the Sherpas hang prayer flags above the camp.

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:22.959
The wind is charged with spreading the prayers to all winds to bring them luck.

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:37.864
In addition, there are earthly and material offerings for the lama.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.154
This ceremony,

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:40.754
also has its price

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.750
To conclude the Puja,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.209
the participants throw flour in the air.
