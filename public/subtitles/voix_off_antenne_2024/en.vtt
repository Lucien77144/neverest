The summit of Everest has been reached over 11,200 times since the first ascent in 1953.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.409
The installation of a wifi antenna 'Everest Link' illustrates the impact

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.899
of the economic and technological expansion of the mountain.

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.950
This technological advancement reflects the effort to meet the needs of climbers and visitors,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.360
but also raises questions about the preservation of the environment and local culture.
