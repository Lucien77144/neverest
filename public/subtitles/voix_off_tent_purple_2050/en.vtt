In 2050,

00:00:01.15 --> 00:00:02.27
the summit of Everest,

00:00:02.27 --> 00:00:05.02
once a majestic sanctuary,

00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:07.28
is now surrounded by an ocean of tents.

00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:10.21
The mountain is now nicknamed "Yellow Mountain"

00:00:10.21 --> 00:00:13.22
due to the sea of tents that emerges above the snow.
